/**
 * S175 — deadman switch for a BLOCKED CLIENT THREAD.
 *
 * <p>Every stall guard in this project (E199, S156, S160, S164, the E98/E99 freeze
 * detector, the S152 onStop marker) is evaluated <em>from inside the tick</em>. They can
 * only ever observe a bot that is still ticking. None of them can observe the failure
 * that actually killed run X.
 *
 * <p>Run X did not die from a driver bug. {@code trace.log} — written by
 * {@link T2Trace} on the client thread, one line per tick — ends at
 * {@code t=8139 clk=7:06.7}. The tick immediately before it covers
 * <b>19.7 seconds of wall clock</b>:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   MOVE t=8128 clk=6:46.5 ph=PORTAL @-1.5,49.0,-77.6 ... sel=6 child=HolePillarTask
 *   MOVE t=8129 clk=7:06.2 ph=PORTAL @ 0.3,51.0,-79.1 ... sel=7 child=HolePillarTask
 *   MOVE t=8139 clk=7:06.7 ph=PORTAL @ 0.3,51.0,-79.1  (last line in the file)
 * </pre>
 *
 * One tick consumed ~20s (the bot moved 2 blocks and rose 2 y during it), then the
 * client thread stopped ticking entirely while the game log kept printing
 * "Refreshed inventory..." and "World save took 0ms" for another 22 minutes. The
 * harness {@code timeout 3300} was the only thing that ever ended the run.
 *
 * <p>A thread that is blocked cannot notice that it is blocked. This watchdog is
 * therefore driven by a daemon thread, and it measures the one quantity the blocked
 * thread cannot fake: <b>the passage of wall-clock time with no tick progress</b>.
 *
 * <p>It deliberately does NOT try to unstick the client — there is no safe way to
 * interrupt an unknown blocking call from outside. It does three things:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>logs the stall loudly and early, with the whole state that is needed to
 *       diagnose it (position, child, phase, inventory) — including the WORST single
 *       tick observed, which is the signature of this failure;</li>
 *   <li>records a LONG single tick as its own fault code (S176) even if the client
 *       recovers, because a 20-second tick is a bug whether or not it is terminal;</li>
 *   <li>after {@link #FATAL_MS}, exits the JVM with a distinctive code so the harness
 *       stops burning the remaining timeout budget, and the run is not mistaken for
 *       "the bot was slow".</li>
 * </ol>
