/**
 * Modern RSG driver with stall guards.
 *
 * Stuck-between-tasks bugs this revision closes:
 *   1. New child task instance every tick (active was unused) — AltoClef restarts
 *      the child if isEqual is picky. Children are now sticky.
 *   2. LOOT wander never times out — after LOOT_MAX_TICKS we force iron mining.
 *   3. Same chest re-looted forever — looted positions are blacklisted.
 *   4. `|| true` forced a 4-bed sheep grind before the stronghold.
 *   5. Having 10 obsidian called get(obsidian) instead of building a portal.
 *   6. wanted==null immediately spawned BeatMinecraftTask, which then fought
 *      this phase machine next tick.
 *   7. Piglin trade could run forever before a single blaze rod.
 *   8. isFinished() never flipped DONE, so @testrun2's timer never stopped.
 *   9. Phase could flip PORTAL while still missing a bucket if flint dropped
 *      from an RP chest — portal task then stalls. Bucket is required first.
 *  10. Water + tungsten lock with no child swap — WaterBailTask is injected.

     * (`active.getClass() == wanted.getClass()`) then compares TimeoutWanderTask against a
     * freshly built CollectBlazeRodsTask, fails, and does `active = wanted`. That tears the
     * whole search down: CollectBlazeRodsTask.onStart() -> resetSearch() clears
     * `alreadyExplored` and nulls the searcher, and the fortress/blob search restarts from
     * scratch.
     *
     * Measured on run F, Nether phase:
     *   New searcher: [-7, 10]   <- SAME CHUNK, four separate times
     *   New searcher: [-7, 10]
     *   New searcher: [-7, 10]

     *   "Search finished" / "Target object search failed": 0  <- it never completed once

     * the bot orbited spawn for ~80s then swept west at 0.44 blocks/sec for 100s.
     *
     * This is the exact same failure shape as S146 (a per-tick recompute tearing down a
     * running ResourceTask) and S143 (a per-tick re-issue resetting a latched task). The
     * fix is the same: while a blaze search is LIVE, do not restart it.
