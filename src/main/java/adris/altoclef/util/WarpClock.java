/**
 * Sim time warp: runs the integrated server AND the client tick clock N times faster so a
 * singleplayer test run plays out in 1/N of the wall-clock time.
 *
 * Both clocks must move together. Scaling only the server leaves the bot (client-side
 * physics and input) at 20 TPS; scaling only the client makes block breaking and furnaces
 * lag behind the bot. 1.16.1 has no /tick command, so ServerTickWarpMixin and
 * ClientTimerWarpMixin do it by hand. On 1.20.3+ WarpCommand uses vanilla /tick rate.
 *
 * Singleplayer only. On a real server the client timer would read as speed hacking.
 * Wall-clock timers (TimerReal, keepalive, T2Deadman) are NOT scaled: they get more game
 * time per real second, so they become more lenient, never stricter.
