# TenorClef 0.22.2

Every build runs on [Ostinato](https://github.com/vexrypt-rgb/Ostinato) (the Baritone fork), not upstream Baritone.
Fixes on top of 0.22.0. (0.22.1 was tagged with incomplete notes; use 0.22.2.)

## Fixes

- Dive: the bot sinks under a roof edge instead of jumping into it, and no longer freezes against it.
- Swimming out onto a shallow shore ledge climbs it instead of sinking.
- Chat logs a "swim stall" line when a swim movement is stuck, to make reports easier to diagnose.

# TenorClef 0.22.0

This release rolls up everything since 0.20.0 (the 0.21.0 tag was never published).

## Highlights

- Freecam: `#freecam` with a GUI toggle, a ghost of the bot showing its current task, and an opacity slider. Includes fixes for respawn and a ghost mixin crash.
- Showcase command and tab: parkour, swim, dive, boat, kinematic and physics demos, with a sealed pool corridor so the bot has to swim.
- Movement fixes from the bundled Ostinato jars: swim entry off shallow ledges, waterfall swimming, boat placement, robust jump templates, scissor underflow.
- Starts on quick-play worlds; 1.21.4 GUI and dropdown fixes.

## Experimental builds

- 1.21.11 and 26.3 compile and package from the same source, but have not been played in-game. Treat them as previews.
