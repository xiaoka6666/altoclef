# TenorClef

TenorClef is an autonomous Minecraft client bot derived from AltoClef. It combines
high-level objective tasks, survival and inventory behavior with the Ostinato
pathfinding engine. Its current focus is reliable autonomous play, speedrun-oriented
tasks, and a modern Fabric target.

TenorClef is not affiliated with AltoClef, Marvion, or MiranCZ. Those projects are
the upstream history of this fork.

## Supported versions

TenorClef always runs on [Ostinato](https://github.com/vexrypt-rgb/Ostinato), so it is only built
for the Minecraft versions Ostinato is built for:

| Minecraft | Status | Ostinato | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.21.4 | Primary | `main` (`libs/baritone-unoptimized-fabric-1.21.4.jar`) | Anarchy target; vanilla recipe-book crafting disabled (1.21.2+ servers do not sync recipes) |
| 1.16.1 | Legacy | branch `1.16.1` (`libs/baritone-unoptimized-fabric-1.16.1.jar`) | Legacy pairing |
| 1.21.11 | Experimental | branch `1.21.11` (built from source) | Not a release target |

The other versions under `versions/` (1.21.1 down to 1.16.5) are only steps in the source
preprocessor chain; they are not compiled or released. The complete, version-matched setup is in
[the Ostinato wiring guide](docs/OSTINATO_WIRING.md).

## Install

1. Download the TenorClef Fabric jar for your exact Minecraft version from this
   repository's [Releases](https://github.com/vexrypt-rgb/TenorClef/releases).
2. Place it in the instance's `mods` directory with Fabric Loader and Fabric API.
3. Install the matching Ostinato jar when the release notes require it. Do not add a
   second Baritone jar unless the release notes explicitly say to do so.
4. Start a single-player test world first. Include the game version, TenorClef and
   Ostinato versions, mod list, and `latest.log` when reporting a problem.

Each release lists the matching Ostinato jar in its notes (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)). If the Releases page is empty,
build from source using the instructions below rather than downloading an upstream
AltoClef jar.

## Build from source

TenorClef uses Java 21 for the current modern modules. On Windows run:

```bat
gradlew.bat :1.21.4:build
```

On macOS or Linux run:

```sh
./gradlew :1.21.4:build
```

For a version that depends on a local Ostinato build, follow the wiring guide first.
The initial Gradle configuration can take a while because Minecraft is remapped.

## Movement backends

Every build uses Ostinato, the AltoClef-compatible Baritone fork. On the modern targets,
Tungsten is an optional travel backend; mining, building, and inventory operations use
Ostinato's Baritone processes. Ostinato also carries the encrypted `#swarm` link for
multi-bot groups, including coordinated region builds (`#swarm build`); see Ostinato's
`docs/REGION_BUILD.md`.

When using an Ostinato-enabled pairing, its `movementBackend` setting selects
`baritone`, `tungsten`, or `auto`; `auto` falls back to Baritone when Tungsten is not
installed. The 1.16.1 pairing also has an experimental physics-driven `kinematicTravel`
controller, plus `pitfallAvoidance`. See [Ostinato's README](https://github.com/vexrypt-rgb/Ostinato) for
backend details.

## Benchmarking movement

The in-game `@pathbench` command measures the pathfinder and the movement layer:

- `@pathbench search [-|setting=a,b] [reps]` times path searches, optionally sweeping a setting.
- `@pathbench travel [baritone|tungsten|kinematic] [reps]` runs end-to-end trials over a fixed
  set of goals and records reached/stalled and ticks per goal.

Results are written as CSV to `run/pathbench/`. Latest 1.16.1 travel runs (16 goals; baritone and kinematic × 3 reps, physics × 1; kinematic from a later run):

| Mover | Goals reached | Avg ticks (reached goals) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baritone | 48/48 | 418 |
| Kinematic (experimental) | 46/48 | 456 |
| Physics search (experimental, `physicsTravel`) | 15/16 | 401 |

The averages only cover goals each mover reached. The bench origin moves between runs, so
compare runs taken together; Baritone's misses here include all three tries at one goal
where it stops 3 blocks short. Single-rep runs are noisy; re-run with 3 reps before drawing conclusions.
